Using the General Tab, you will be able to configure the settings for
the Export and Writeback Functions.
## Export
In the Export settings, you will be able to configure the export
functionality. There is also an option to include the navigation
settings panel in the Export File (see Figure below).

<img alt="Export option" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/epf.png')} />

The saved file can be exported and this exported file can be used in the
“Import from Excel” option in “Import an Advanced Model” tab (Refer <Link to={useBaseUrl('/docs/general/getting-started')}> `Section: Import from an Export File <IEF>`  </Link>).

## Writeback

You will be able to export the Scenarios configured in the valQ through
an URL by entering the Writeback URL in the Text Box (see Figure below).

<img alt="Export Scenarios via Writeback URL" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/wrb.png')} />

The different simulations of planning results can be written back to the
underlying systems using the URL exposed as part of the valQ. Using the
URL, the user can do write-back scenario nodes to the underlying system.
