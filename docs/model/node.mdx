Each node represents a metric, and can contain the following:

  - Name of the value driver or KPI
  - A sparkline graph indicating the recent trend
  - The value of the metric in bold letters

<img alt="Node Details" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/13.1.png')} />

In addition, each node also contains several performance metrics (see
Figure below). They are listed as follows:

  - The Fiscal Year variance of the metric vs. a benchmark (in this
    case, Sales Forecast vs. Sales Budget) – this is shown in both % and
    absolute terms
  - Absolute value of the metric for the current month (usually the
    first period in the series)
  - Variance of the metric vs. a benchmark for the current month – this
    is shown in both % and absolute terms.

A node may be decorated by a performance indicator color band on the
left – typically Green (for good), Amber (neither good nor bad) and Red
(Poor).

## Node Editor
By clicking the Edit option you will be able to view the Edit Settings
for the Node.

<img alt="Nodes Structure with Edit option" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.7.png')} />

The Edit Settings are categorized as follows:

1.  General
2.  Configuration
3.  Display
4.  Simulation
5.  Business Definition
6.  Conditional Formatting
7.  Secondary KPI

### General

In General settings you will be able to configure the Node details such
as Unique ID, Title and the Title Prefix when outside the Tree with the
values as shown in the below Figure. The Title Prefix can be set at Node
Level and during simulation it is useful to identify at which node the
parameter value changes. The additional properties of the Node Tab has
been listed in Section 13.2.

<img alt="Edit Node – General Settings" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.8.png')} />

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the valQ
screen as shown below.

<img alt="valQ screen with General settings" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.9.png')} />

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Unique ID for the Parent
Node is “TOP” and the Title of the Parent Node is “Net Profit”.

In our other example as shown below, we have configured the Title Prefix
for two different Nodes (see Figures below).

<img alt="Node with Prefix value as Spouse 1" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.10.png')} />

<img alt="Node with Prefix value as Spouse 2" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.11.png')} />

Based on the above set of configurations, you will be able to view the
valQ screens as shown below.

<img alt="valQ screen with Spouse 1 Prefix" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.12.png')} />

<img alt="valQ screen with Spouse 2 Prefix" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.13.png')} />

From the above two Figures you can observe that the “Gross Salary” is
the common Title for two different Nodes. In order to differentiate
them, we have provided the value for “Title Prefix when outside the
Tree” as Spouse1 for one Node and Spouse 2 for the other Node. After
simulation, you can see which Node’s value has been changed.

### Configuration

In Configuration Settings, you will be able to configure the Node
details such as Calculation Method, Time Aggregation, Desired Trend and
Value Range with the values as shown in the below Figure.

<img alt="Edit Node – Configuration Settings" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.14.png')} />

Based on the above Configuration settings, you will be able to view the
valQ screen as shown in the below Figure.

<img alt="valQ with Configuration settings" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.15.png')} />

From the above Figure you can observe that in the Navigation Panel, the
value that is displayed in the Constraints section will lie in the range
from minimum 10 to maximum 100 for a specific month based on the
configuration done for the Value Range. In our example, the calculation
method is selected as 'Subtract Children (a-b-c)' meaning that from the
first child node the other child nodes will get subtracted and its
result will be displayed in the Parent Node. The Time Aggregation is set
to Sum of Periods where we have considered 12 months as period. As the
result of simulation, each Node will display the values based on the Sum
of Periods. Also the “Desired Trend” has been set to the Increase
option. When simulated, the desired Trend for the Revenue will be
increasing and the value for the Total Cost will be decreasing.

For the Calculation Method being selected as 'Data Source', you can
follow the steps as explained in the following link: <a href="https://valq.com/blogs/3-methods-of-mapping-valq-nodes-to-data" target="_blank">https://valq.com/blogs/3-methods-of-mapping-valq-nodes-to-data</a>

For other options of calculation method, you can refer the link: <a href="https://valq.com/blogs/assigning-values-to-nodes-in-valq/" target="_blank">https://valq.com/blogs/assigning-values-to-nodes-in-valq/</a>


On selecting 'Formula' and clicking on the formula field, you will be
able to see a dropdown of the formulas that are supported. For a list of
formulas that are available in valQ, you can refer to the link <Link to={useBaseUrl('/docs/faq/formula-list')}> Functions </Link>


#### Template Nodes

Also you can create a Template Node for the already existing Node. It is
very specific that the Template Nodes should not map the Parent Node.
You need to select the particular Node and copy a Node under the
selected Node for creating the Template Node.

In the below Figure as an example, you can observe that a copy of
Revenue Node has been created by the right click copy and paste actions.
Now the copied Revenue Node version is labelled as “Revenue 2” in
General Property of the Edit Node Window (see Figure below).

<img alt="Edit Node: Copy of Revenue Node labelled as Revenue
2" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/13.3.png')} />

Now navigate to the Configuration property of the Edit Node Window. Set
the Calculation Method to the option Template based on the node. Also
set the Node to use as Template to the option 1:Revenue (see Figure
below).

<img alt="Edit Node: Calculation Method selected as Template based on other node
and Revenue Node to be used as Template" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/13.4.png')} />

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Templated
Node Revenue 2 having all its Nodes similar to the Revenue Node as per
our example.

<img alt="Templated Node" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/13.5.png')} />

### Display

In the Display Settings, you will be able to configure the Node Display
settings such as Node Display, Scale, Value Decimal Places, Value
Prefix, Value Suffix and Details on Click with the values as shown in
the below Figure.

<img alt="Edit Node – Display Settings" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.16.png')} />

Based on the above Display settings, you will be able to view the valQ
screen as shown in the below Figure.

<img alt="valQ with Display settings" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.17.png')} />

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Node Display is set to
“Show” option. The Scale has been set to the User Selected option and
now you can edit the Scaling options in the Value Display under Settings
Tab. When the Scale is set to other options you will not be able to edit
the Scaling options in the Value Display. You can also view the Nodes
with the values configured with Value Decimal Places as “0”, Value
Prefix as “$” and Value Suffix as “r”.

Since the Details on Click option is enabled in the Display settings,
you can observe the Pop up screen being displayed after clicking the
Node “Net Profit” (see Figure below). If the Details on Click option is
disabled in the Display settings, then you will not be able to view the
Pop up screen.

<img alt="Pop up screen" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.18.png')} />

#### Composite Node Display

A Node in a tree can now be added with a maximum of two composite nodes
which can be taken from any nodes. For our example, the below Figure
shows the Tree structure with several nodes.

<img alt="Tree with several nodes" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cnd1.png')} />

For our example, two child nodes from the Node “Total Cost” needs to be
included as composite nodes to the Node “Revenue”. For adding the
composite nodes, go to the configuration settings window of the Node
“Revenue” by clicking the Edit and Configure Node option (see Figure
below).

<img alt="Adding Composite Nodes" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cnd2.png')} />

In the Edit Node panel, go to the Display settings and add the Nodes
“10:Production Cost” and “36: Realisation Cost” as Composite Nodes to
the Node Revenue (see Figure above). Now the Tree structure will get
configured based on the above settings (see Figure below).

<img alt="Tree with composite nodes" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cnd3.png')} />

You can observe that the Nodes “10:Production Cost” and “36: Realisation
Cost” have been added as the composite nodes to the node “Revenue”. Also
when a simulation is done in the actual Nodes (10:Production Cost” and
“36: Realisation Cost), the similar simulation will get reflected in
the composite nodes and it is vice versa (see Figure below).

<img alt="Composite Node with simulated values" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cnd4.png')} />

The composite nodes will have no effect in the Table view structure of
the Tree. In the Quick Editor screen, you can view the composite node
ids in a separate column by enabling the composite node option from the
“selected columns” drop down menu (see Figure below).

<img alt="Quick Editor with composite node id display" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cnd5.png')} />

### Simulation

In the Simulation Settings, you will be able to configure Simulation
details such as selection of Default Simulation Method and assigning the
Node for the Linked Simulation (see Figure below). You have the option
to enable/disable the Simulation function for the Node (see Figure
below).

<img alt="valQ with Simulation Settings" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.19.png')} />

In this Simulation Settings, you have selected the Default Method as
“Constant" for the Simulation and you have selected the Node for the
Linked Simulation as “First Node” (see Figure above). Based on the above
settings you will be able to view the valQ page as shown in the Figure
below. The other options for the Default Simulation Method are Change
Percentage, Manual and Growth Percentage.

<img alt="valQ screen with Constant value selection" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.20.png')} />

From the above Figure, you will be able to view the pop window as shown
in the above screen by clicking the Arrow icon in the Net Profit Node as
shown in the Figure below.

<img alt="Net Profit Node" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.21.png')} />

Now click the Edit option in the pop window as shown in the Figure
below.

<img alt="Edit option" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.22.png')} />

By clicking the Edit option, you will be able to view and edit the input
values for the Simulation Period (see Figure below).

<img alt="Edit Inputs for Simulation Periods" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.23.png')} />

For our example, the value for March month has been edited and as a
result it gets reflected for all the Nodes.

### Business Definition

Using this option, you will be able to configure the Business Definition
details such as Description, Header, Footer and Technical Notes with the
values as shown in the below Figure.

<img alt="valQ with Business Definition Settings" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.24.png')} />

Based on the above settings, you will be able to view the Business
Definitions details in the Pop up screen as shown below.

<img alt="Pop up screen with Business Definitions" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.25.png')} />

### Conditional Formatting

Using the Conditional Formatting option, you will be able to apply the
Alert Thresholds and Rules at the specific Node Level (see Figure
below). For our example, the Node "Revenue" has been selected.

<img alt="Conditional Formatting Settings for Node" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cfn1.png')} />

In the Conditional Formatting settings for the Node "Revenue", you have
3 different options as highlighted in the above Figure.

When the option "Global or Inherited Rule" is selected, then the
Conditional Formatting Rules configured as Global Level in the Settings
Tab will be applied here.

Now set the option as "Custom Rule: Overwrites default or any inherited
rules" as shown in the below Figure.

<img alt="Conditional Formatting Settings for Node - Custom Rule option with
Percentage selection" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cfn2.png')} />

The Custom Rule option can be configured based on variance percentage
values and the values applied at period level (see Figure above).

For our first example, set the option for the Custom Rule as
"Percentage" and also enable the property "Apply to Descendants". Set
the Threshold values as shown in the above Figure. After simulation, you
can find that the Variance percentage value for the Node "Revenue" falls
in the Threshold range (4%)\* which is between -10% to -1% and based on
that condition, the status bar for the Node Revenue is yellow color (see
Figure below).

<img alt='Custom Rule option with Percentage value selection for the Node "Revenue"' src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cfn3.png')} />

Also you can observe that the Descendant Node "Copper Price" has been
updated with the same Threshold settings based on our configuration. The
Variance percentage value for the Descendant Node "Copper Price" falls
in the Threshold range (8%)\* which is Above 1% and based on that
condition, the status bar for the Descendant Node "Copper Price" is
green color (see Figure below).

<img alt='Custom Rule option with Percentage value selection for the Descendant Node "Copper Price"' src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cfn4.png')} />

For our second example, set the option for the Custom Rule as "Value
(applied at Period Level) - see Figure below.

<img alt='Custom Rule option with value selection for the Node "Revenue"' src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cfn5.png')} />

Set the Threshold values as shown in the above Figure. After simulation,
you can find that the Metric value for the Node "Revenue" falls in the
Threshold range (522.3)\* which is Above 1 and based on that condition,
the status bar for the Node Revenue is green color (see Figure below).

<img alt='Custom Rule option with Value selection for the Node "Revenue"' src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/cfn6.png')} />

**Note:** "\*" denotes that the Metric values get calculated based on
the Period Level. For example when it is a Year, it will take the value
of 12 being multiplied with the range value that we provide.

Now set the option to "Hidden: No Rule will be applied to this Node".
You can observe that no range values can be provided for the Conditional
Formatting and since there will be no status color for that Node being
simulated.

### Secondary KPIs

Secondary KPIs helps user to aggregate and visualize additional or
alternate KPI values in the node widget. Specifically, in a model with
two data series, these are the set of secondary metrics captured under
the primary value of the node

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPI.1.png')} />

As a default, there are three secondary values displayed for a dual
series data in the following order 

1. Full Period Variance between baseline and comparison metric (in % and absolute values) 
2. Baseline metric value for the first period in the series 
3. Variance for the first period between baseline and comparison metric (in % and absolute
values)

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPI.2.png')} />

Secondary KPI option lets users to customize these secondary values or
metric according to their preference

Users can achieve this using: I. Secondary KPI option based on Formulas
II. Secondary KPI option based on Template

1.  Secondary KPI option based on Formulas

In the below model screenshot, the user can display the data value from
Operating Profit %’ and ‘Operating Expense Ratio’ as Secondary KPI
values to the TOP node ‘Operating profit’.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPIF.1.png')} />

Under the 'Operating Profit' node setting's 'Secondary KPI' ribbon, user
needs to select the 'Formula' button and fill-in the label name and the
custom formula for his additional Secondary KPIs

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPIF.2.png')} />

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPIF.3.png')} />

Upon completing, the user can see ‘Operating Profit %’ and ‘Ops Expense
Ratio’ values displayed as Secondary KPI values to ‘Operating profit’

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPIF.4.png')} />

2.  Secondary KPI option based on Template

In the model, user can display ‘Contribution’ of each of the child nodes
Water, Beverages, and Others to their parent node Gross Profit. User
should define ‘Contribution’ as a Formula in one of the nodes and call
them out for ‘Contribution’ calculation using the Template option at the
other nodes.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPIT.1.png')} />

In this example, user can define the formula in 'Water' node under the
node setting's Secondary KPI by selecting 'Formula' button and defining
the 'Custom Formula' Upon completion, 'Contribution %' is displayed as a
Secondary value of the node widget.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPIT.2.png')} />

To borrow this formula on other nodes, user can fo into the Secondary
KPI setting of the 'Beverages' node, select the 'Template' button, and
choose to display the same formula as the 'Water' node. User can
instantly see the corresponding 'Contribution %' at the 'Beverage' node.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPIT.3.png')} />

Similarly, following the same steps for the 'Other' node helps the user
to instantly visualize ‘Contribution %’ for the all the child nodes to
Gross Profit

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/SecKPIT.4.png')} />

## Quick Editor in Node Tab

Using the Quick Editor option in the Node Tab, you will be able to view
the entire Tree Hierarchy in a Grid View. For our example, the below
Figure shows the normal Tree Hierarchy View.

<img alt="Normal Tree Hierarchy View" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe1.png')} />

After clicking the Quick Editor option as shown in the above Figure, you
will be able to view the Grid View as shown below. You can observe that
there will be a Business View information in the Formula column and it
will get displayed when you select the Business View option (see Figure
below).

<img alt="Grid View" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe2.png')} />

In the Grid View, you will be able to edit the changes and save it so
that the changes will get reflected in the Tree Structure which can be
viewed in the canvas. In the Grid View, you can also Expand and Collapse
the Node Structure using the Expand and Collapse icons (see Figure
below).

<img alt="Grid View in Expanded Form" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe3.png')} />

For our example, the above Figure shows the expanded form of the Grid
View. The below Figure shows the collapsed form of the Grid View.

<img alt="Grid View in Collapsed Form" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe4.png')} />

You will be able to import and export the data in the form of excel file
using the Import from Excel and Export to Excel buttons as shown in the
below Figure.

<img alt="Grid View - Import from Excel and Export to Excel" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe5.png')} />

The Export to Excel File button will be only functional in the web
version of the Power BI (see Figure below).

<img alt="Export to Excel File" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe6.png')} />

The exported file can be edited and it can be imported by clicking the
Import from Excel File button.

<img alt="Import from Excel File" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe7.png')} />

The import function can be done by browsing the location of the file
(see Figure below).

<img alt="File Location" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe8.png')} />

The Columns cab be filtered based on the selection from “Selected
Columns” Drop Down (see Figure below). All the Columns can be selected
to get displayed in the grid or the user can select the columns of their
choice.

<img alt="Filtering Columns in the grid" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe9.png')} />

The below Figure shows that all the columns are being selected and they
are displayed in the grid. The user can scroll the Horizontal scroll bar
in order to view the remaining columns.

<img alt="Grid Display with all the columns being selected." src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe10.png')} />

The below Figure shows that only the selected columns get displayed in
the grid.

<img alt="Grid Display with the selected columns" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe11.png')} />

Also the user has the option to edit the properties like Formula,
Calculation Method and Aggregation Method directly in the Grid view
where it gets updated in the actual properties in the Advanced Editor.
In our example, you can view that the Formula has been double clicked
for editing (see Figure below).

<img alt="Grid view edit for Formula Column" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe12.png')} />

The above Figure shows that the Formula for the row item Copper Sold has
been edited. As another example, the below Figure shows that the
Calculation Method has been edited.

<img alt="Grid view edit for Calculation Method Column" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe13.png')} />

In a similar way, the following columns can be edited in the Grid view.

  - Manual Data for Primary
  - Manual Data for Comparison

The below Figures represents the screen shots for both Manual Data for
Primary and Manual Data for Secondary.

<img alt="Grid View Edit for Primary Data" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe14.png')} />

<img alt="Grid View Edit for Comparison Data" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe15.png')} />

The Node Search for the columns Linked Node, Linked Simulation Node and
Weighted Average Node in the Data Grid will be in Drop Down List and the
user can select the appropriate Node from the Drop Down List. For our
example, the Node Search for the Linked Simulation Node has been done
(see Figure below).

<img alt="Node Search for Linked Simulation Node Column" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe16.png')} />

Similarly the Node Search for the Source Key Column will be in Drop Down
List showing the Nodes from the assigned Data Source and the user can
select the appropriate Node from the Drop Down List (see Figure below).

<img alt="Node Search for Source Key Column" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe17.png')} />

There is an option to lock the simulation for the Node in the Grid View.
The same function can be also done in the exported Excel File and the
Excel file can be imported in the Grid to see the updates done for the
locked simulation.

The below Figure shows the Locked Simulation in the Grid View.

<img alt="Locked Simulation in Grid View" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe18.png')} />

The below Figure shows the Locked Simulation in the Excel File which can
be imported to the Grid view.

<img alt="Locked Simulation in Excel File" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe19.png')} />

The rows can be reordered for the child nodes which exists under a
Parent Node. The below Figure shows the Grid view before reordering the
child nodes.

<img alt="Grid view before reordering the child nodes" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/qe20.png')} />

The below Figure shows the Grid view after reordering the child nodes.
